set -euo pipefail
# -e	Exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero status (an error). Prevents scripts from continuing after a failure.
# -u	Treat unset variables as errors and exit immediately. Helps catch typos and missing env vars.
# -o pipefail	Fail a pipeline if any command in the pipeline fails (not just the last one). Improves reliability of `grep
